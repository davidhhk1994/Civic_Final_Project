# Civic_Final_Project

#### Basemapping excercise iPython Notebook, has all basic data wrangling and prep. I have merged all data sets including flood zones. So now we only have the data from flood areas.

#### The output data set is saved in this folder as well as Threeway.csv, to use as a map I believe we need to export as a shape file. Will work out later.
